# Project-2-Eagle-Eye
A tool to predict the genre of a song based on its various metrics (danceability, energy, tempo, etc.) 

# Requirements:
* python 3 

# Installation Instructions
* Run the following command from the app root directory to install the required python packages.

  ``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```

# Run Appliction

Open the data_cleaning.ipynb file in jupyter notebook or vscode and run the script. This will train the model and evaluate the model scoring metrics. 

We attempted to make this work with additional songs that were not part of the dataset, however we ran into troubles with producing the same metrics that spotify provides in their data set and having the numbers match up. So we had to settle with training and testing with only the dataset that we had available to us.
